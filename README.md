First Website Ever :O
=================
Nina Nguyen

In this project, I made a different game/application for each of the 4 pages that I created:
- The first page is a simple game where you are a circle and you are trying to smash some lines that are flying across the screen.
- The second page is a drawing application.
- The third page is an interactive color-changing button
- The fourth page is a simple car that moves left and right with the arrow keys.
